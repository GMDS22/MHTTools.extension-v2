# Meinhardt UI Theme System

This document is the single source of truth for UI theme tokens and usage rules across tools under MEINHARDT.tab.

## Goals

- Keep all tool interfaces visually consistent.
- Improve visual quality and readability.
- Allow fast global theme updates by changing tokens in one place.

## Core 3-Role Palette

### 1. Primary (Blue)

- Purpose: identity, primary actions, key emphasis.
- Base token: `--theme-primary: #0E639C`
- Hover token: `--theme-primary-hover: #1177BB`

### 2. Secondary (Teal)

- Purpose: supportive highlights, secondary action states, contextual chips.
- Base token: `--theme-secondary: #1FA6A6`
- Hover token: `--theme-secondary-hover: #22B8B8`

### 3. Accent (Amber)

- Purpose: attention and semantic highlight (warnings, notable states, selected key indicators).
- Base token: `--theme-accent: #F2B134`
- Strong token: `--theme-accent-strong: #D99A20`

## Neutral Support Tokens

- `--surface-0: #1A1A1C`
- `--surface-1: #232327`
- `--surface-2: #2A2A2E`
- `--border: #3A3A40`
- `--text-main: #E8E8E8`
- `--text-muted: #8A8A9A`
- `--success: #4CAF7D`
- `--danger: #CC4B4B`

## Usage Rules

1. Use Primary Blue for primary buttons, step badges, and major anchors.
2. Use Secondary Teal for supporting emphasis, alternative actions, and non-critical highlights.
3. Use Accent Amber for alerts, callouts, and high-attention visual markers.
4. Keep core identity to the 3-role palette; do not introduce additional identity colors unless explicitly approved.
5. Preserve contrast and readability on dark surfaces.

## Component Guidance

- Buttons:
  - Primary action: blue background, white text.
  - Secondary action: neutral surface with teal border or subtle teal emphasis.
  - Critical warning action: amber accent treatment.
- Combo boxes:
  - Closed-state background must use a dark surface token such as `surface-1` or `surface-2`, never a light or white fill inside dark-theme tools.
  - Selected text and dropdown-item text must use `text-main` or another clearly contrasting foreground.
  - Dropdown popup backgrounds and item rows must use dark surface tokens distinct from the foreground text so the selected value remains readable.
- Cards/Sections:
  - Use consistent surface layering (`surface-1` and `surface-2`) and border token.
- Typography:
  - Keep body text in `text-main`; supporting hints in `text-muted`.
- Lists/Tables:
  - Keep alternating row contrast subtle and consistent.

## Migration Checklist

1. Update tokens here first.
2. Propagate token usage to XAML resource dictionaries/styles.
3. Remove one-off hardcoded colors where practical.
4. Verify labels/tooltips remain clear and consistent.
5. Run visual QA pass for consistency and contrast, including ComboBox closed state, popup state, and selected-item readability.
