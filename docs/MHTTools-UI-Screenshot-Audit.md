# MHTTools UI Screenshot Audit

Updated: 2026-05-20

This audit tracks the UI screenshot coverage required by the tool-description standard.
It compares the current MeinhardtTabTools.html entries against confirmed XAML-backed tool interfaces and the screenshot assets currently available in MEINHARDT.tab/Documentation.panel/ToolsDescription.pushbutton/.

## Completed In This Pass

- Fixed the broken Family Renamer screenshot reference in MeinhardtTabTools.html.
- Added the existing Views Links Manager screenshot to the Views Links Manager card.
